# Payment-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Fraud is one of the major issues accross industries such as banks, life insurance, health insurance, and many others... including the local coffee shop around the neighboorhood corner. But one such fraud that has been increasing a lot these days is fraud in making payments. For this ML project, the aim is proffer a solution model to fraud detection with machine learning. The ML model will be assessing individual customer behaviour based on the data to spot an anomaly thereby detecting fraudulent transactions

Tools: Python, Google Colab, Excel

Model: Logistic Regression

Model Evaluatiion:  Confusion Matrix Algorithm
