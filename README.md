# Payment-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Fraud is one of the major issues accross industries such as banks, life insurance, health insurance, and many others... including the local coffee shop around the neighboorhood corner. But one such fraud that has been increasing a lot these days is fraud in making payments. For this ML project, the aim is proffer a solution model to fraud detection with machine learning, as well as making real-time decisions. ML model will be assessing individual customer behaviour as it happens. It’s constantly analyzing ‘normal’ customer activity, so when it spots an anomaly it can automatically block or flag a payment for review.

Tools: Python, Google Colab, Excel

Model: Logistic Regression

Model Evaluatiion:  Confusion Matrix Algorithm
